The dictionary file (words) was obtained from some web site somewhere,
but unfortunately I cannot currently figure out where that was!!
It is the /usr/share/dict/words file which comes with some fairly recent
version of Linux...  Anyway, stripped out all 24000+ words which contained
apostrophes, but otherwise the file is unmodified.
